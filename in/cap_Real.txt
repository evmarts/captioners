Stop dreaming of it and start working for it.
Make today count because you will never get it back.
The distance between your dreams and reality is action.
No matter how you feel, show up and never give up.
One day I'll be in a place I've always wanted to be.
The starting point for all achievement is desire.
Stay focused and hungry for success.
My best is yet to come.
I did not come this far to only come this far.
If you say you'll do it, do it.
Don't fear failure, fear laziness.
